Metaclasses and Descriptors in Python

This module covers advanced Python features that don't exist in Java/C#:
metaclasses (classes that create classes) and descriptors (how properties work).
These are powerful tools for framework development and advanced Python programming.

Topics covered:
- Metaclass fundamentals and use cases
- Custom descriptors for validation and transformation
- Property patterns and advanced property usage
- Class decorators vs metaclasses
- Real-world examples: ORM-like field definitions, API decorators
