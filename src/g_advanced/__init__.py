Advanced Python Topics for Enterprise Development

This module contains advanced Python topics specifically designed for
experienced Java/C# developers transitioning to Python in enterprise
environments. These topics cover enterprise-level patterns, performance
optimization, and Python-specific features that don't exist in Java/C#.

## Complete Topic Coverage:

### üèóÔ∏è g_project_structure/ - Enterprise Project Architecture
- Large-scale Python project organization
- Package design and dependency management
- Configuration and environment handling
- Testing strategies for enterprise applications

### üé® i_design_patterns/ - Advanced Design Patterns Workshop
- Singleton Pattern (4 different Python approaches)
- Factory Pattern (registry-based, dynamic)
- Observer Pattern (event system with decorators)
- Strategy Pattern (functional vs OOP approaches)
- Command Pattern (functional approach with undo/redo)

### üîÆ j_metaclasses/ - Metaclasses and Descriptors Workshop
- Custom metaclasses for validation and method registration
- Descriptors for field validation and caching
- Advanced property patterns
- Class decorators vs metaclasses comparison
- Simple ORM framework example

### ‚ö° k_concurrency/ - Advanced Concurrency Workshop
- ThreadPoolExecutor vs ProcessPoolExecutor
- Advanced asyncio patterns (resource pools, circuit breakers)
- Multiprocessing with shared memory
- concurrent.futures bridge patterns
- Performance monitoring and profiling

### üîó l_integration/ - Enterprise Integration Patterns Workshop
- Message Queues and Event-Driven Architecture
- RESTful API Design and Implementation
- Database Integration Patterns
- Microservices Communication
- Caching and Performance Patterns

### üöÄ m_performance/ - Performance Optimization Workshop
- Profiling and performance measurement
- Memory optimization and garbage collection
- Algorithm optimization and data structures
- Parallel processing optimization
- Database and I/O optimization

### üõ†Ô∏è n_devops/ - DevOps and Deployment Workshop
- Docker containerization for Python applications
- CI/CD pipelines with Python-specific considerations
- Configuration management and environment handling
- Monitoring and logging for Python applications
- Infrastructure as Code for Python services

### üìä o_data_engineering/ - Data Engineering Patterns Workshop
- ETL/ELT pipeline design and implementation
- Stream processing and real-time data handling
- Data validation and quality assurance
- Big data integration (Pandas, Dask, Spark)
- Data API design and data services

### üèõÔ∏è p_ddd/ - Domain-Driven Design Workshop
- Value Objects and Entity patterns in Python
- Aggregate roots and domain services
- Repository patterns with Python specifics
- Domain events and event sourcing
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns

## Learning Path for Java/C# Developers:

1. **Start with Design Patterns** - Familiar concepts with Python twists
2. **Explore Metaclasses** - Unique Python features for framework development
3. **Master Concurrency** - Python's unique threading/async model
4. **Learn Integration Patterns** - Enterprise-grade Python applications
5. **Optimize Performance** - Python-specific optimization techniques
6. **Deploy with DevOps** - Production Python deployment strategies
7. **Handle Big Data** - Modern data engineering with Python
8. **Apply DDD** - Enterprise architecture patterns in Python

Each workshop includes:
- Task-based learning approach with clear objectives
- Java/C# comparison examples where relevant
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced concepts
- Real-world enterprise scenarios and use cases
- Comprehensive test functions to validate understanding
- Implementation templates and skeleton code to complete

## Prerequisites:
- Completion of basic Python modules (a_basics through f_async)
- Understanding of enterprise software development concepts
- Familiarity with design patterns and architectural principles
- Experience with Java/C# enterprise development
