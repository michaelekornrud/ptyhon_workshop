Advanced Design Patterns in Python

This module demonstrates how to implement classic Gang of Four design patterns
in Python, with comparisons to Java/C# implementations. Python's dynamic nature
and first-class functions often provide more elegant solutions than traditional
object-oriented approaches.

Topics covered:
- Singleton Pattern (with Python-specific considerations)
- Factory Pattern (using Python's dynamic capabilities)
- Observer Pattern (with decorators and descriptors)
- Strategy Pattern (functional vs OOP approaches)
- Decorator Pattern (structural pattern vs Python decorators)
- Command Pattern (functional programming approach)
