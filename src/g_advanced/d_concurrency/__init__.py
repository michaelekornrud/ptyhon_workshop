Advanced Concurrency in Python

This module covers enterprise-level concurrency patterns beyond basic async/await.
Java/C# developers need to understand Python's unique concurrency model and
how to handle CPU-bound vs I/O-bound tasks effectively.

Topics covered:
- ThreadPoolExecutor vs ProcessPoolExecutor (CPU vs I/O bound)
- asyncio advanced patterns (custom event loops, protocols)
- concurrent.futures (bridge between sync and async)
- Multiprocessing patterns (shared memory, queues, locks)
- Performance profiling and optimization
