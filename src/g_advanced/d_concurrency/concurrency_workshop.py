Advanced Concurrency Workshop - Enterprise Python Concurrency Patterns

This workshop covers advanced concurrency patterns for enterprise applications.
Java/C# developers need to understand Python's unique concurrency model and
the differences between threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.

Complete the following tasks to master Python concurrency.

TASK 1: Understand Threading vs Multiprocessing

Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) affects threading differently than
Java/C#. Learn when to use threads vs processes for different workload types.

Requirements:
- Compare performance for I/O-bound vs CPU-bound tasks
- Implement thread-safe shared state
- Use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-intensive work
- Handle inter-process communication
- Implement graceful shutdown patterns

Example usage:
# I/O-bound task - use threads
result = run_io_bound_tasks(urls, max_workers=10)

# CPU-bound task - use processes
result = run_cpu_bound_tasks(numbers, max_workers=4)
